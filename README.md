# Eye-Movement-Tester
Program to be used with eye tracking glasses to test the various movements of the eye, such as saccades, OKN, smooth eye tracking, etc.

This is a simple repo, currently containing only two Python files.

The first, EyeMovementGame.py, is the testing program I created using pygame. It currently has three options available to test -- Saccades, Smooth Tracking, and OKN (Optokinetic Nystagmus). The fourth option, currently not implemented, is VOR or Vestibulo-ocular Reflex. 

The second file, MLTest.py, was my first attempt at using sklearn machine learning functions to analyze the data gathered using the Tobii Pro Glasses and the testing program. The saccade option was used, and the test was semi-successful. I unfortunately lost the data gathered, but the function can serve as a starter for the next iteration.
